## **Java Abstraction - Detailed Notes**

---

### **What is Abstraction?**

Abstraction is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that focuses on exposing only the essential details of an object while hiding the underlying complexity. It simplifies the interaction between objects by allowing users to focus on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

In Java, abstraction is achieved using two primary constructs:

* **Abstract Classes**
* **Interfaces**

---

### **Abstract Class**

An abstract class serves as a base class that provides a common definition for its subclasses. It:

* Is declared with the `abstract` keyword.
* Cannot be instantiated directly.
* Can include both abstract methods (declared without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).
* May contain constructors, static methods, instance variables, and final methods.

This approach allows abstract classes to provide partial implementation, leaving the rest to be defined by subclasses.

---

### **Abstract Method**

Abstract methods:

* Are declared using the `abstract` keyword.
* Do not contain a body (implementation).
* Must be implemented by any non-abstract subclass.

They define a contract that every subclass must fulfill, ensuring consistent behavior while allowing flexibility in how that behavior is executed.

---

### **Key Characteristics of Abstract Classes**

1. **Constructors in Abstract Classes:**

   * Though abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, they can define constructors.
   * These constructors are invoked when a subclass is instantiated and are useful for initializing common state.

2. **Static Methods:**

   * Abstract classes can have static methods.
   * These belong to the class rather than instances and cannot be overridden but are inherited.

3. **Final Methods:**

   * Final methods can exist in abstract classes.
   * These cannot be overridden by subclasses, ensuring certain behaviors remain unchanged.

4. **Instance (Concrete) Methods:**

   * Abstract classes may define fully implemented methods that can be reused or extended by subclasses.

### **What Cannot Be Abstract (And Why)?**

Certain elements in Java cannot be declared abstract due to their intended purpose:

* **Constructors**:
  Constructors are meant to instantiate and initialize objects. Since abstract classes cannot be instantiated, having an abstract constructor serves no logical purpose.

* **Static Methods**:
  Static methods are tied to the class itself and are not involved in polymorphism. Since abstract methods must be overridden at the instance level, static methods cannot be abstract.

* **Private Methods**:
  Abstract methods must be visible to subclasses to be overridden. Private methods are restricted to the declaring class and thus cannot fulfill the requirement for abstraction.

* **Final Methods**:
  Final methods are explicitly designed to prevent overriding. Since abstraction requires overriding in subclasses, final and abstract cannot coexist.

---

### **Benefits of Abstraction**

* Enhances readability and maintainability of code by hiding complexity.
* Promotes modular design and loose coupling between components.
* Focuses on the behavior (what) instead of the implementation (how).
* Improves security by exposing only relevant parts of a class or module.

### **Abstract Class vs. Interface – A Comparison**

| Feature       | Abstract Class                                 | Interface                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instantiation | Not allowed                                    | Not allowed                                                                     |
| Methods       | Can include both abstract and concrete methods | Only abstract methods (Java 7), with default/static methods allowed from Java 8 |
| Fields        | Can have instance variables                    | Only public static final constants                                              |
| Inheritance   | Supports single inheritance                    | Supports multiple inheritance (via implementation)                              |
| Constructors  | Allowed                                        | Not allowed                                                                     |

### **Conclusion**

Abstraction is a powerful design concept that emphasizes functionality over implementation. It promotes clarity, reusability, and separation of concerns. While abstract classes provide a partial blueprint, interfaces offer a fully contract-driven approach to designing flexible and extensible systems.
